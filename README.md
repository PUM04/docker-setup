# docker-setup
This repository contains some examples of how docker is used and a start of the Docker configuration to be used by the project.

## Learning
Recommended videos for running a container, understanding Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml

> Note: Docker volumes are used for real time updating files in the container, these apparently have problems working with windows. So WSL is recommended for development in windows.
