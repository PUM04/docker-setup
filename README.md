# docker-setup
This repository contains some examples of how docker is used and a start of the Docker configuration to be used by the project.

## Learning
Recommended videos for running a container, understanding Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml

> WINDOWS USERS: Docker volumes are used for real time updating files in the container, these apparently have problems working with windows. So WSL is recommended for development in windows. Docker volumes are defined in the docker-compose.yaml file. It should work without WSL but you might have to create a new container for every change.
